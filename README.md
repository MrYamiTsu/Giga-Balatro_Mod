<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Steamodded/smods">Steamodded </a>1.0.0~BETA-0711a or higher is required.<br>
    Can be useful to have <a href="https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman">Talisman</a> too.
</p>
<p>Just download the zip file, extract it and place it in your Mod folder.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Cross-Mod</h2>
<p>There are some extra assets if you have other mods. Here is a list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid">Cryptid</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Elements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>28+ Jokers</li>
    <li>23 Foods (+1 CrossMod)</li>
    <li>4 Booster Packs</li>
    <li>5+ Enhancements</li>
    <li>2 Vouchers</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Some Jokers have secret interactions with other Jokers.</em><br>
<em>*Many artworks are either unfinished or missing.</em></p>

<h2>Additional Infos</h2>
<p>
    If a whole asset is in comment, don't remove it from the comment. It's an idea and this may cause the game to crash.<br>
    If you have any ideas for how the mod's elements might interact, feel free to DM me on Discord (<strong>@MrYamiTsu</strong>).
    You can also send me artwork of the elements if you like (I'll mention you in the credits).
