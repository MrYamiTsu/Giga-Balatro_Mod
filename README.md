<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Steamodded/smods">Steamodded </a>1.0.0~BETA-0711a or higher is required.<br>
    Can be useful to have <a href="https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman">Talisman</a> too.
</p>
<p>For the most stable version, download the zip file from latest release. And for the latest version (can be unstable), download the zip file from the Code button. After downloading, extract the file and place it in your Mod folder.</p>

<h2>Cross-Mod</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of crossover with <a href="https://github.com/Joglacraft/Fools-Gambit">Fool's Gambit</a>, so I really recommend checking it out. And the mod itself is absolutely worth playing, it’s genuinely great on its own.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some extra assets if you have other mods. Mainly Food cards.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves">CardSleeves</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Icecanno/Partner-API/">Partner-API</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback">Paperback</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Infos</h2>
<p>
    Giga first appear in the <strong>Wheel Of Mods</strong> of <strong>MurphyObv</strong> on January 16th 2026 and has not been selected yet.<br><br>
    Some content work weirdly, sometimes.<br><br>
    If a whole asset is in comment, don't remove it from the comment. It's an idea and this may cause the game to crash.<br><br>
    If you have any ideas for how the mod's elements might interact, feel free to ping me in the <strong><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1398876204622286958">Giga</a></strong> post on the Balatro Discord.
    You can also send me artwork of some elements if you want (I'll mention you in the credits).
